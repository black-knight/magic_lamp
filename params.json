It provides a JavaScript client API for easy content creation.\r\n\r\nA working prototype setup consisting of a portable projector and a Raspberry Pi with attached camera module can be seen below. Further info can be found on the github page.\r\n\r\n![MAZE game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-andersen/Interactive-Tabletop-Projected/master/Photos/maze_1.jpg)\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\n* Easy setup and content creation with plain HTML and JavaScript.\r\n* Detecting bricks on a tiled board.\r\n* Detecting simple shapes. Simple feed the algorithm with an image of the shape and start using the detector.\r\n* Detecting images. Simple feed the algorithm with an image and start using the detector. (WIP!)\r\n\r\nGetting up and running\r\n======================\r\n\r\nThe computer vision backend is written in Python/OpenCV and communicates with the webpage through WebSockets.\r\n\r\nGiven you have Python and OpenCV installed, getting up and running is as simple as starting the backend server:\r\n\r\n    $ cd Server/src\r\n    $ python main.py\r\n\r\nand referencing the client library in a web page and initializing it as follows (CoffeeScript source):\r\n\r\n    @client = new Client()\r\n    @client.connect((() => @onConnected()), ((json) => @onMessage(json)))\r\n\r\n    onConnected: ->\r\n        @client.reset()\r\n\r\n    onMessage: (json) ->\r\n        switch json[\"action\"]\r\n            ...\r\n\r\nTo create a tiled board of size (32, 20) and wait for a brick to be found in any of the top/left corner tiles implement the following few lines:\r\n\r\n    onMessage: (json) ->\r\n        switch json[\"action\"]\r\n            when \"reset\" then @client.initializeBoard()\r\n            when \"initializeBoard\" then @client.initializeTiledBoardArea(tileCountX=32, tileCountY=20, x1=0.0, y1=0.0, x2=1.0, y2=1.0, areaId=0)\r\n            when \"initializeTiledBoardArea\" then @client.reportBackWhenBrickFoundAtAnyOfPositions(areaId=0, validPositions=([0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 0]))\r\n            when \"brickFoundAtPosition\" then alert(\"Brick found at position: \" + json[\"payload\"][\"position\"])\r\n\r\nSee Content/MAZE for a complete reference implementation of a simple MAZE game.\r\n\r\nPhotos\r\n======\r\n\r\n![Magic Lamp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-andersen/Interactive-Tabletop-Projected/master/Photos/lamp_1.jpg)\r\n![Magic Lamp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-andersen/Interactive-Tabletop-Projected/master/Photos/lamp_2.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Magic Lamp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-andersen/Interactive-Tabletop-Projected/master/Photos/lamp_3.jpg)\r\n![Magic Lamp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-andersen/Interactive-Tabletop-Projected/master/Photos/lamp_4.jpg)\r\n",
